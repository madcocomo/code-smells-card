# Code Smells Card

The code smells contents comes from https://www.industriallogic.com/blog/smells-to-refactorings-cheatsheet/
The original alphabetical ordering list is not very handful. So I recomposed it as cards. It is much easier to cut to little pieces for group discussion or ordering.

### TBD

- Refactoring cards
- Split big smell cards
- Tranlate to other language?
- Enable for two sides print
